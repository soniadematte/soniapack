# The function to make a function is called 'function'
# We have to put the argument (x,y)
# we have to use the {} to make R know that there the function has to do those things
# We have to assign a name to the function

simplestuff <- function(x,y){
  z=x+y
  return(z)
  }

# We put the function in R, and assign numbers to x and y
